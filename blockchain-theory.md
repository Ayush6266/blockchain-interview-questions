# üß† Blockchain Theory & Protocol-Level Questions

This section includes questions about blockchain internals, consensus algorithms, Ethereum upgrades, account abstraction, L1/L2 architecture, token standards, and cryptographic primitives. These are commonly asked in protocol roles, DeFi engineering, Layer 2 R&D, and security research interviews.
